/**

 Notes:

 - uint16_t is preferred over size_t because long is never needed by the
   size of the packets or the buffers of this application.
   (Kees Bakker does not agree with this. size_t is not the same as long.
    On AVR a size_t is uint16_t. On SAMD we don't care too much about the
    data size, a long is fine.)
 - Currently, only one received packet is supported. Every time a packet is
   received, the previous one is overwritten.
 - Also multiple responses from the server (with Frame Pending Bit set) are
   not supported.
 - The port of the received packet is not returned.
